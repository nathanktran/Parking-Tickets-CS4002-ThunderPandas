## Data Summary

The dataset spans over two decades, running from 1999 up to the present day, and includes key features like the date and time the ticket was issued, the street name where the ticket was issued, and a description of the violation (e.g., "Overtime Parking," "No Parking").

This data is openly hosted on the Charlottesville Open Data Portal at https://opendata.charlottesville.org/datasets/0ae373f4c2884abbb296500125bb9d8a_7/explore, where it can be directly previewed, filtered, and downloaded in various formats. It provides researchers with a rich source for urban studies, policy evaluation, and time-series analysis of enforcement patterns.

## Provenance

It comprises 506,311 entries, each representing an official, timestamped record generated during the municipal enforcement process. The data documents parking violations issued within the city from 1999 up to the present, including key details such as the violation type, time of issuance, location, and administrative statuses for waivers and appeals.

## Ethical Statements
The Charlottesville Parking Tickets dataset is a highly objective resource derived directly from enforcement records, which limits the scope of ethical concerns compared to behavioral or demographic datasets. The primary consideration revolves around privacy and re-identification risk. While license plates are anonymized, the combination of geographic and temporal data could potentially be linked with external public records. This combination raises a concern about the potential for surveillance or tracking of frequent offenders. Researchers must be careful not to facilitate re-identification and should utilize the data strictly to analyze policy effectiveness.
